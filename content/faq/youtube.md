LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to republish their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC. This program is available to new and existing LBRY users - installing or using our platform is not a prerequisite to syncing your channel. The process involves obtaining your permission to sync, gathering your channel and video metadata (i.e. covers, thumbnails, etc), creating a channel for you on LBRY and publishing your videos to it, and finally [transferring the ownership directly to your LBRY Account](#claim).  

To sync your existing YouTube channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.com YouTube Sync page](/youtube).

### What are the Steps?

There are three main steps to this program: 

1) [Queue](#queue) - authorization to allow us to begin syncing. You can now claim a [reward if eligible](#reward)

2) Sync - creating your channel and republishing content to a secure account. [Some limitations apply](#limits)

3) [Transfer](#claim) - claiming the ownership of your channel and content directly into your LBRY account. LBRY will continue publishing new content to your channel

The transfer process ensures you have full control of your content and channel. LBRY will only have access to publish new items you upload from YouTube, which will go directly into your account. Otherwise, LBRY cannot remove or change any of your content once it's been transferred. You can learn more about the difference between [sync and transfer below](#transfer).

**It is important that you have a [backup of your wallet](faq/how-to-backup-wallet) after the transfer process is initiated.** New users will have the option of doing so when they first sign into LBRY (Sync Balance setting when entering email). 

### Authenticating with your YouTube Account and Sync Details {#queue}
Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to re-publishing your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one-year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](/youtube).

### How to Receive Your LBRY Credits for Syncing {#reward}

You can do this once your channel has been synced.

1) Download, install and run the LBRY App from [lbry.com](https://lbry.com/get)
2) Make sure the email saved in the application matches the email address on your [Sync Status Page](/youtube/status) - you can update this and make sure to verify via the email you receive (the email may not update but it will link together)
3) Click on your balance in the top right and select on the **Rewards**. This is also available from the Overview page (click the Account icon next to the balance)
4) Scroll to the "YouTube Reward" tile and click Get XXXX LBC. If you met a particular subscriber threshold (minimum 1K subs, 10 videos, and recent content), you will receive the appropriate amount of credits. If your account is under review, please check back later. Thank you for your patience! 

### How to Transfer/Claim my Channel and Content {#claim}

Currently, content transfer is available in the LBRY Desktop application as of 10/3/2019. It will be available on [LBRY.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv) in a couple of weeks. In order to claim your channel, the email saved in the app must match the email address on your [Sync Status Page](/youtube/status) - you can update this and make sure to verify via the email you receive. Once the channel and content is transferred, you'll be able to use this channel to comment, publish, and edit existing content in the LBRY app. 

If you are signing into the LBRY app for the first time, you'll be presented with an option to claim your channel. If the channel is still queued, you'll be able to claim it from the Channels page (right hand side above Publishes) after its synced. If you created any channels or published content locally before transeferring, see the [cleanup section  below](#cleanup).

### What's the difference between Sync and Transfer? {#transfer}

When a channel is synced, it means the content has been mirrored to LBRY and available on the network for anyone to view. YouTubers will get an email once this is completed. The transfer proces is the final step of sending the channel and content to the YouTuber's LBRY account so they can publish/control the content. LBRY will continue publishing content uploaded to YouTube directly to your account after transfer. 

Feature | Sync | Transfer |
:------------ | :-------------| :-------------|
Your Youtube publishes will be synced | yes |  yes |
You have access to content and channel LBC from tips | no |  yes |
Your content shows up in the app under your Publishes | no |  yes |
You are responsible for keeping your wallet safe | no |  yes |
You can use the app to publish to the channel | no |  yes |

### Limitations of Republishing Videos {#limits}

There is a size limit per video of 2GB. There is a total count limit of your most recent 1,000 videos. What this means, if that isn't clear, is that your most recent 1,000 videos that are smaller than (or equal to) 2GB in size will be synced to LBRY. **Content that's marked as potential copyright violations by YouTube also will not be synced**

### I created a channel and/or published on my LBRY app before syncing, what do I do now? {#cleanup}

It is recommended you delete your locally created channel, which can be done before or after the channel transfer process. If you published any content locally, you can edit the content and use your newly transferred channel to include it, or you can simply delete the locally published content as well. Unless you plan to experiment with a different channel name in the meantime, please be patient until the channel is tranferred to you.

To delete the original channel, you'll need to navigate to the Wallet page (click on your balance in the top right). Next, click `Full History` and find the original channel you created. You may need to paginate in order to find it. Make sure it is the right channel to delete by clicking on the name from the history page first. Then use the trash can icon to remove it. 

You can do the same for any content you published locally. The other option is to edit the content and select your newly tranferred channel. This will make the content appear under this channel. 

### Why can't I Sync my Channel?

Not all channels may qualify for the YouTube sync / rewards program, but users can always [upload the content themselves](https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-publish) through the LBRY app instead. This is based on a careful review of subscriber counts, views, and the content itself. Thank you for respecting our decision. If you require more details, please [contact us](mailto:hello@lbry.com).

### I need some Help!
