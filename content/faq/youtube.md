***Service Announcement: We're close to having an automated transfer process where creators will claim their channels with the Desktop app. If you'd like to request a manual transfer sooner, please see https://lbry.com/claim-wallet***

LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to sync their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC. This is intended for content creators that aren't quite ready to make the switch over to using the LBRY app at this time, and want us to keep their YouTube channel updated on LBRY. Not all channels qualify for the YouTube sync / rewards program, but users can always [upload the content themselves](https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-publish) through the LBRY app instead. 

To sync your existing channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.com YouTube Sync page](/youtube).

***IMPORTANT NOTICES: You won't see your content in the LBRY app under `Publishes` nor have control of the channel until LBRY transfers control of the synced content to you. We're actively working on an automated process for this which will be ready by the end of September (we missed our original Summer estimate due unforeseen bugs). You can request at manual process at https://lbry.com/claim-wallet which requires some technical knowledge. Your content will be accessible through the LBRY Desktop app and [LBRY.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv) (see the links in your sync email). You are able to claim your Sync Reward immeadiately if you qualify (min 1K subs).**

**If you want to experiment with publishing manually in the LBRY app, you can create a test channel under a different name. If you create one with the same name, there will be duplicates and we won't be merging them. You can delete the content/claim you created locally using the trash can icons on the transactions page. Thank you for your patience and understanding!**

### Authenticating with your YouTube Account and Sync Details
Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to re-publishing your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

There is a size limit per video of 2GB. There is a total count limit of your most recent 1,000 videos. What this means, if that isn't clear, is that your most recent 1,000 videos that are smaller than (or equal to) 2GB in size will be synced to LBRY. **Content that's marked as potential copyright violations by YouTube also will not be synced**

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one-year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](/youtube).

The sync process stores your wallet in a secure location, as you may not have the LBRY app installed already. If you have over 100K subs and are comfortable with [swapping out wallet files](/faq/how-to-backup-wallet), we can work with you to transfer your synced wallet as part of a manual process. Typically, we recommend waiting until we have an automated solution for transferring this data to you via the app. Please reach out to [help@lbry.com](mailto:help@lbry.com) if you have any questions about this process.

### How to Receive Your LBRY Credits for Syncing

You can do this once your channel has been synced.

- Download the LBRY App from [/get](https://lbry.com/get)
- Run the LBRY App
- Make sure the email saved in the application matches the email address on your [Sync Status Page](/youtube/status) - you can update this and make sure to verify via the email you receive (the email may not update but it will link together)
- Click on the **Rewards** option from under Account in the sidebar. 
- Scroll to the "YouTube Reward" tile and click Get XXXX LBC.
- If you met a particular subscriber threshold (minimum 1K subs, 10 videos, and recent content), you should receive the appropriate amount of credits.

### I created a channel and/or published on my LBRY app, what do I do now?

You can delete this channel and any content you published using the transactions page and trash can icons. Unless you plan to experiment with a different channel name in the meantime, please be patient until the channel is transferred to you (see above notice for timing information). 

### How do I Publish using my Channel?

You won't see your content in the LBRY app under `Publishes` nor have control of the channel until LBRY transfers control of the synced content to you. We're actively working on an automated process for this which will be ready by the end of the northern hemisphere summer. However, your content will be accessible through the LBRY Desktop app and [LBRY.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv) (see the links in your sync email). If you have over 50K subscribers and want to do this via a manual process, see the [wallet claim page](https://lbry.com/claim-wallet)

### What's the difference between Sync and Transfer? {#transfer}

When a channel is synced, it means the content has been mirrored to LBRY and available on the network for anyone to view. YouTubers will get an email once this is completed. The transfer process is described in the important notice above, which is the final step of sending the channel and content to the YouTuber's wallet so they can publish/control the content. This last step is still being actively developed and we'll let you know via email once the content is ready to be transferred. Until then, you won't see the channel/content in your Publishes section, nor be able to publish as that channel outside of the YouTube sync process.
