category: getstarted

---

The LBRY Desktop app and lbry.tv allow you to view content, upload your digital media for free or at a set price, tip your favorite creators, send/receive LBRY Credits (LBC) and earn credits through [LBRY Rewards](/faq/rewards). The app and web version run on top of the [LBRY protocol](/faq/what-is-lbry) which is a peer to peer, decentralized file sharing and payment network secured by blockchain technology.

The purpose of this FAQ is to answer questions about some of the basic functionality available on LBRY Desktop / lbry.tv. Please see our [other FAQ entries](/faq) for additional information.

**Important notes:**

1. By default, LBRY Desktop saves any content you view to disk, see the [explanation below](#disk). You can modify this behavior on the Settings page.

2. Rewards are completely optional, you can use LBRY without them. You'll need to acquire LBC to publish, but viewing is free.

3. To edit your channel, click on Channels from the right-hand side of the app and select the desired channel. You'll see an edit button next to the channel name. If using spee.ch uploads for thumbnails/covers, make sure to click the upload button after selecting the files.

4. To sync balances and preferences across devices, make sure you have Syncing enabled on the Settings page.

## What is the purpose of having my email connected to LBRY?
Emails are collected to authenticate a lbry.tv account and [uniquely identify](/faq/identity-requirements) users so that they can be eligible for [LBRY Rewards](#rewards), sync account data, and to stay up to date on the latest LBRY happenings. See our [Privacy FAQ](/faq/privacy-and-data) for more information on what data is collected.

## How do I change my LBRY connected email?
If you ever need to change your LBRY email address or sign out, please see [this guide](/faq/how-to-change-email). If you sign into a new email and need to transfer your verification status and account (lbry.tv only users), you'll need to [reach out to us](/faq/support) in order to link your accounts.

## What if I want to run LBRY on multiple computers or different Windows accounts?
If you want to run LBRY on multiple PCs or on other platforms like Android, you can sign in with the same email on all devices. Your account data and preferences will be synced as long as it's enabled in Settings.

## What are LBRY Rewards? {#rewards}
[LBRY Rewards](/faq/rewards) are used to distribute LBRY Credits (LBC) to new and existing users by allowing them to explore app functions and complete tasks which generate LBC as a reward. In order to be eligible for rewards, you need to [verify your identity](/faq/identity-requirements) which uniquely identifies you as an LBRY user.

## What is a wallet and how do I find it? {#wallet}
A wallet is a secure, digital wallet used to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies like LBRY Credits(LBC). LBRY comes with its own wallet and is stored locally on your device and nowhere else unless you enable the Sync feature. **If you do not enable syncing, it is critical that you [backup your wallet data](/faq/how-to-backup-wallet) in case you lose access to your PC or need to [migrate](/faq/backup-data) to a new one.**

To find your wallet on LBRY, click on your LBC Balance showing at the top right of the App (Balance may show as `0 LBC` if you have not credits). Clicking it will give you a dropdown menu, select `Wallet` from the dropdown and it should display the wallet overview page which shows your balance, send / receive and recent transactions.

The LBRY wallet is different from other cryptocurrencies because it also stores your shared content's metadata in the form of [claims](/faq/naming) when using the [publishing features](/faq/how-to-publish). Claim related [wallet transactions](/faq/transaction-types) ensure that the blockchain uniquely identifies your content and the payment/tips can be routed appropriately.

## Where do I find my LBC wallet address?
You can find your wallet address by first clicking on your LBC Balance showing at the top right of the App (Balance may show as `0 LBC` if you have not credits). Clicking it will give you a dropdown menu, select `Wallet` from the dropdown.
It'll come up with the wallet overview which shows your balance, LBC address and recent transactions.

Your wallet holds multiple receiving addresses (lbry.tv only users won't see this option), and new ones can be generated by clicking "Get New Address". Your wallet balance is the sum total of all the LBC available in each of your addresses.

## Where can I get more LBRY Credits?
You can [earn more LBC](/faq/earn-credits) or [purchase LBC from exchanges](/faq/exchanges).

## Where is all my LBRY Desktop data stored? {#data}
Please see the [LBRY directories FAQ page](/faq/lbry-directories) for more information on where LBRY data is stored. Besides the internal LBRY data, you can also configure your LBRY download directory via the option at the top of the Settings page (gear icon in the top right).

## Why is content downloaded to my PC even when I stream? {#disk}
LBRY is a decentralized peer to peer protocol, meaning there are no centralized servers or a single entity storing all the files (like YouTube). Instead, data is stored on each participant's computer locally (similar to BitTorrent). When you stream or download, LBRY will store the content in encrypted chunks called [blobs files](/faq/lbry-directories) and seed it to the entire network so others can also download from you. It will also store the completed file in your downloads folder. You can configure these storage options on the Settings page.

## I want to share my content, where do I start? {#publish}
Please refer to our [publishing guide](/faq/how-to-publish) as a reference to assist you through the publishing process.

## Where can I see my downloads?
The downloaded contents can be found on the right side of the LBRY Desktop app under Library. This is not available on lbry.tv currently.

## How can I delete my downloads?
The downloaded contents can be found on the right side of the LBRY Desktop app under Library. Select the item you want to delete, and then click the trash can icon on the file page.

## Where can I see my publishes?
You can find published items under Publishes on the right side of the LBRY Desktop / lbry.tv.

## How do I know if I'm sharing content and helping the LBRY network properly?
The easiest way to confirm that you are sharing correctly is to determine if the port used for seeding (3333) is open to the rest of the LBRY network. To do so, type 3333 into [this port checking tool](http://www.canyouseeme.org) and check the result. It if shows "open", you are all set. If it shows "closed", you may need to check your router settings for UPnP options (set to enable) or forward TCP port 3333 and UDP Port 4444 to your local computer running the LBRY Desktop. Firewall and NAT settings may also affect the availability of these ports.

## How can I search for content on LBRY?
Searching in LBRY is as easy as typing your search term(s) into the address bar at the top and clicking Enter.
When you press enter, you will be given both the direct URL and search results

## Content consistently fails to stream or download, what should I do?
Please see our [streaming guide](/faq/unable-to-stream) if you consistently cannot download or stream content on LBRY. If you are having intermittent issues with download failures, try closing LBRY Desktop completely (including ending the "lbrynet.exe" process in task manager) and re-initiating the download.

## Some files don't open in the LBRY Desktop or lbry.tv, what's going on?
Currently, the LBRY in-app player supports MP4 videos, MP3s, Images, GIFs, HTML and text files. Even though it doesn't support other formats from within the app or lbry.tv, the files can still be externally opened when using the Desktop app by clicking the **Open** button or navigating to the file by clicking the **Downloaded to** file path on the content page.
