Searching for content on the LBRY Desktop and Android apps is super easy and takes just a couple clicks of the good ole mouse and keyboard. We'll start with Desktop first, see the [Android tutorail below](#android).

Click your cursor into the top search bar, and enter a serach term. Typically you'll see at least 3 items at the top:
1) Search - Default if enter is clicked. This is your typical search option, will return all results matching it. 
2) Exact URL - Select this to navigate directly to the top published content at `lbry://comics`
3) Tag - Select this to navigate to the tag page to browse all content tagged `comics`

If using the default search option, you'll also have access to additional filter to help narrow down the results. First, you can choose from filtering on Files, Channels, or Everything. The files option would return only content published according to the selected file types. If you choose the Channels option, you'll get back results for channels within that search term. Don't forget to give us a thumbs up or down to rate your experience!

### Searching on Android {#android}

To begin your search, select the top search area and begin typing. If you stop for a couple seconds or click enter, the search results will appear. Currently there are no filtering options on this platform.
