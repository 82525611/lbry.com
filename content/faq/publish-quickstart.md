Publishing on LBRY is the process of uploading content so that anyone else in the world can access it. LBRY is unique compared to other alternatives you may have tried since we don't post-process any content (i.e. what you upload is what others see!) and we support any type of digital file. Publishing does require a deposit of LBC and a small transaction fee. 

This tutorial will provide a high level overview of the process, for an in-depth guide on the process, see our [Publishing FAQ](/faq/how-to-publish).

We'll start with the LBRY Desktop example, please scroll down or [click here](#android) for the Android instructions.
