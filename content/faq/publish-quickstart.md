Publishing on LBRY is the process of uploading content so that anyone else in the world can access it, without middlemen or trusting any parties. LBRY is unique compared to other alternatives you may have tried since we don't post-process any content (i.e. what you upload is what others see!) and we support any type of digital file. Publishing does require a deposit of LBC and a small transaction fee, but don't worry about that for now and get those [funny cat videos](https://beta.lbry.tv/cats:cb) ready! 

This tutorial is meant to provide a high level overview of the steps. For an in-depth guide on the process, please see our [Publishing FAQ](/faq/how-to-publish).

We'll start with the LBRY Desktop, please scroll down or [click here](#android) for the Android instructions. 

### Publishing on Desktop
First, you'll want to find the Publish option from the Account drop down. You can also click **New Publish** from the Publishes page (right hand side). Next, select the file you want to publish by clicking **Choose File**. 

*Note: We recommend MP4s for video content, but you choose any type of file. If it's not supported directly in our apps, other users can download and view it externally.*

Next, you'll want to fill in details for the content you are uploading. A title is required, the rest like description, thumbnail, tags, and channel are optional.
