# How Do Trending, Top, and Discovery Work on LBRY?

As of the [LBRY Erikson Release](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/releases/tag/v0.34.0), the LBRY desktop app and web app support dynamic trending and top views based on your interests and the channels you follow. This article explains how these features work. 

### How Do I Use It?

At the top of your Home area, you can toggle between Trending, Top, and New for either your interests (tags you follow), your channels, or the whole network. When Top is selected, you can also choose the relevant time frame.

### How Do Each of These Views Work?

| View   |  What It Shows  |
| --- | --- |
| _Trending_ | Trending shows the content that has positively deviated by the greatest amount in terms of tips and support it has received over the last 24 hours, compared to the baseline performance over the last 7 days. |
| _Top_ | Top shows the content published within the selected period that has received the largest total amount of tips and supports. |
| _New_ | New shows the newest content by time. |

All of these views work the same whether you are viewing tags you follow, channels you follow, or the whole network.

### How Do I Customize These Views For My Interests?

#### Customizing Tags

To customize the tags you follow, click "Customize" from your homescreen and select content areas that interest you.

#### Customizing Channels

There are two ways to follow channels:

1. Click the follow button for creators that you are interested in. These buttons appear on channel and content pages.

2. Click "Customize" from your home screen to discover and follow new channels. Suggested channels include most subscribers on LBRY and featured creators.

### How Is This Different From YouTube?

YouTube uses obscured, secret algorithms that are designed to be biased in favor of the mainstream media and other creators they prefer rather than being neutral to all content ([See Veritasium's take on this](https://beta.lbry.tv/my-video-went-viral-here-s-why/)).

LBRY creates open-source code that allows all of the world to see precisely how our features work, and help to write articles like this one that spell it out in plain language. The source code for the Trending/Top/New functionality is viewable [here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/blob/master/lbry/lbry/wallet/server/db/trending.py).
