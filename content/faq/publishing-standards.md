Even though LBRY does not enforce any file size, dimension, or aspect ratio properties, our applications are optimized to provide the best experience for viewing content thumbnails, channel covers, and channel profile thumbnails. If you are using the apps to upload the images, these uploads go through [spee.ch](https://spee.ch) which is limited to 10MBs per file. 

### Supported file types
A majority of image file types including jpg, png, and gif can be hyperlinked or uploaded. 

### Content thumbnails
When publishing content thumbnails, we recommend a size of 800x450 and/or an aspect ratio of 16:9.

- **cover photo**: size of 1000x160 and/or an aspect ratio of 10:1.6
- **profile thumbnail**: size of 300x300 and/or an aspect ratio of 1:1 (square).
