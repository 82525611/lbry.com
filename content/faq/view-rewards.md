title: What are content view tips/rewards?
category: publisher
order: 2
---

At LBRY Inc, we want to reward creators for quality content that other LBRY users will enjoy. If you publish quality original content, you may receive additional rewards for views from validated lbry.tv accounts on behalf of us.

LBRY tracks views from reward validated users and will send LBC tips for each viewer's first 10 daily views on qualified content. Creators see these on their wallet page as Tips (filter on Received + Tips) and they will be summed up monthly on the Rewards page under `Content View Tips: Month Year`. You may [unlock the tips](https://lbry.com/faq/tipping) to have the show in your balance, but while locked, they help your content be discovered.

**Please note: Not all accounts may qualify for view rewards and this does not affect actual tips from your followers. These are generally reserved for original content and may not apply to non-video/audio content. Accounts that participate in follow for follow / view for view activity will not be eligible. These rewards are currently granted on a per account basis. LBRY reserves the right to disable view rewards on any account, similar to other rewards.**

## Requirements and disqualifications

Existing YouTube synced channels with over 500 subscribers and other established creators on LBRY are automatically opted in.

- The majority of the content must be original content in video or audio form (may expand to other formats later).
- The content and channel must be properly tagged.

Typical disqualifications include:
