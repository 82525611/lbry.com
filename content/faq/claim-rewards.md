You can find the rewards section under the Account menu > Rewards. On Android, click or slide out the menu, and then select Rewards. [Click here to navigate directly to your app](https://open.lbry.com/?rewards).

In addition to the one time rewards, we have a daily reward for watching content you love on LBRY - so make sure to check back often to keep earning! 

These LBC rewards can be used to buy content on the LBRY network, or to tip/support to reward/promote your favorite creator's efforts. Tipps and supports help creators become discovered on LBRY by boosting their status in the network.
