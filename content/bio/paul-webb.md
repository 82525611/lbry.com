Paul Webb is an “architech” who loves designing and building great experiences. He is self-taught and got his start in the recession of ’08 and later gained an apprenticeship from Thoughtbot. The rest, as they say, is history.
When he isn’t building for the web, you can find him building in Fortnite and failing fantabulously.
