The leaves are starting to fall, and that means it’s time for Hackoberfest! Thanks to [DigitalOcean’s hard work](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), open source developers around the globe will be busily hacking away for the month of October.

Open source is (literally) part of our DNA here at LBRY, and we’re always happy when we get an opportunity to support our fellow open source projects. Throughout the month of October, our developers will be hosting informational sessions, meetups, and coding projects to introduce other programmers to the world of open source software and start making contributions immediately. They’ll also be contributing to other open source projects that pique their interest.

### Ready to get involved?
