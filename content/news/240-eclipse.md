## Meet LBRY Eclipse for Android
Today, LBRY releases LBRY Eclipse, the premier mobile app for the LBRY network.

[Download from Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lbry.browser) or [direct download](http://lbry.com/releases/lbry-android.apk).

The biggest change with Eclipse is an introduction for multi-language support. At launch, it comes with support for 12 languages, listed below.

Notifications will be slowly rolled out and turned on in the coming weeks, but as an initial test of the system, everyone will be sent a notification with a special code over the next 24 hours. So make sure youâ€™re up to date!
